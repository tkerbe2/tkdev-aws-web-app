# tkdev Terraform Web App Lab

I've created this lab to tinker with some different ways to create resources with Terraform in AWS and this lab is a simple example of many of the cool things you can create.
I recommend using Terraform Enterprise Cloud to deploy this as it is what I've used to deploy this. GitHub Actions is also a great alternative if you can set the AWS_SERCET_KEY and AWS_ACCESS_KEY in the Secrets.
