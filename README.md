# Web App Lab

I created this lab as an example for my Hennepin Tech students. The first part of this lab is to create a functioning highly available web application in the AWS Console. The second component of this lab is deploying these same resources with code. The focus and intent of this lab is to familiarize with AWS Console (VPC[^1], EC2[^2], S3[^3]) and recognize the advantages of using IaC.  

[^1]: In this lab we specifically build many components with the VPC service: [VPC Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html)
[^2]: In this lab we we create an ALB and EC2 instances with the EC2 service: [EC2 Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)
[^3]: In this lab we create an S3 bucket with the S3 service: [S3 Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)

## (Part 1) ü™õ Manual Creation - Web App Lab

In this first part of the lab you will use the AWS Console to create all lab resources manually. You will gain hands on experience and learn how to use services like VPC, EC2, and S3. To open and download the full lab guide scroll to the link below.

## (Part 2) ‚öôÔ∏è Automated Creation (IaC) - Web App Lab

In this part of the lab you will deploy the exact same infrastructure as you did in part 1, but with code. If you already know how to deploy Terraform or have used Terraform Enterprise Cloud and just want to know how to use the code, scroll down for more details.

[Coming Soon]()

In the terraform.tfvars file you will want to configure the following variables:

| Variable Name | Value and Constraints |
| ---------------|------------------------------|
| region | Should be a valid AWS region |
| org_name | Can be a fake company or just your name for example | 
| env | This is short for environment think: prod, dev, stage, test, etc.. | 
| ssh_key_pair | Required for EC2 instances to launch, you need to create this yourself first |
| instance_type | I try to keep everything free-tier so t3.micro is default | 
| vpc_cidr | This can be any RFC1918, I recommend at least a /23 CIDR to start with |
| availability_zones | Important! This map is what the looping mechanism is used for. Use valid availability zones and keep the key values as they are (0, 1, 2, etc..) |
| borrowed_bits | This is what size of subnets you want, by default I've set it to 5 to create /28 CIDRs | 

Below is another example of the terraform.tfvars file.

```
#========================#
# Declare Variables Here #
#========================#

# Enter the AWS region to deploy to
# Defaults to us-west-1
region = "us-west-1"

# Between 2 and 20 characters
org_name = "tkdev"

# Environment between 3 and 10 characters
# Could be prod, dev, non-prod
env = "sandbox"

# If you want a pair of servers or not
# Naming convention is pri (primary) or sec (secondary)
# Default value is true

# No default value, fill out
ssh_key_pair = "tkdev-ssh-key"

# VM instance type
instance_type = "t3.micro"

#====================#
# Network Variables  #
#====================#

# /23 supports up to 512 usable IPs
# 192.168.10.1 - 192.168.11.254
vpc_cidr = "192.168.10.0/23"

# AZ list used for naming and looping mechanism
# us-west-1 doesn't have a b
availability_zones = {
    0 = "us-west-1a"
    1 = "us-west-1c"
}

# How many subnets to create
# This should match the availability_zones


# What size of network you want
# 5 is a /28
borrowed_bits = 5

```
## Resources Created:
This demo creates the following resources in the following order:

1. VPC
2. Subnets based on what is defined in terraform.tfvars
3. IGW attached to the VPC
4. Default route table that points 0.0.0.0/0 to the IGW
5. Security Group that allows 80 and 22 TCP inbound from anywhere (lock this down for further security)
6. EIPs based on how many zones you've defined (default is 2)
7. EC2 Instance(s) with Amazon Linux based on how many zones you've defined (default is 2)
8. S3 bucket with some randomly generated characters (optionally can use this for logging on the ALB)
